# Perpetually a work in progress

I primarily develop in C++ and extensively use CMake.

## Goals

+ To be able to sustain coding for a living by achieving a _modest_ pay for my efforts.
+ Work as part of a team to develop more complex projects and solutions.

## Focus and Interests

+ Desktop tools and solutions.
+ Computer graphics and realtime rendering.
+ Compilers and data serialization.

## Current Work

### General Modules

+ [CMakeModules](https://github.com/chcly/CMakeModules) - Provides a glue for linking together submodules as well as other miscalenious utilities.
+ [Utils](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Utils.git) - Contains foundation code that is used to construct higher level projects.
+ [ParserBase](https://github.com/chcly/Module.ParserBase) - Is a base class library that can be used to derive more specific parsers.
+ [Xml](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Xml) - A basic Xml parser.
+ [Svg](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Svg) - Is a utility to aid in visual debugging.
+ [Thread](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Thread) - Basic std::thread utility library, optionally uses TBB.
+ [Math](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Math) - Utility math library
+ [View](https://github.com/chcly/Module.View) - Custom widgets and utilities for Qt.

### Test Modules

Modules that are highly experimental and not currently needed.

+ [MetaData](https://github.com/chcly/Module.MetaData) - Converts CastXML output into a type library .  
+ [Python](https://github.com/chcly/Module.Python) - C++ setup to begin a custom binding generator using MetaData.

### Templates

+ [ModuleTemplate](https://github.com/chcly/template) - Repository template for adding new submodules.
+ [QtTemplate](https://github.com/chcly/QtTemplate) - Repository template for adding new Qt projects.

## Utility programs

+ [ResourceCompiler](https://github.com/chcly/ResourceCompiler) - Utility to include files in executables.
+ [code-proxy](https://github.com/chcly/code-proxy) - Work around to control VSCode directories and make updates easier to install.  

## Current Samples

+ [DirectoryView](https://github.com/chcly/DirectoryViewer) - Test file system browser.
+ [Jam](https://github.com/chcly/Jam) - Basic graphing calculator

## Older Works

   Can be referenced and scraped for spare parts or re-envisioned.

+ [InspectionTools](https://github.com/chcly/InspectionTools) - Various command line utilities.
+ [RayTracer](https://github.com/chcly/Raytracer) - Educational ray tracer
+ [MockVM](https://github.com/chcly/Raytracer) - Mock assembly compiler and debugger.
+ [Coursera-HackComputer](https://github.com/chcly/HackComputer) - Circuit emulator and virtual computer.
